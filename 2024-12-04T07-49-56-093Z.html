      <div class="bubble">
        <p>
          PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications, designed
          to keep applications running smoothly, monitor them, and manage their
          lifecycle. Here’s an overview of how PM2 works under the hood:
        </p>
        <h3 id="1-process-management">
          1. <strong>Process Management:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Forking Processes:</strong> When you run a Node.js
            application with PM2, it forks a child process for each application.
            In the case of a cluster mode (enabled with <code>-i</code> flag),
            PM2 will fork multiple instances of your application to utilize
            multiple CPU cores. PM2 internally uses Node's
            <code>cluster</code> module to manage these instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Daemonization:</strong> PM2 runs as a background service
            (daemon), which means that it stays alive even after the user logs
            out. This is done using a process manager to control and monitor
            Node.js processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitoring:</strong> PM2 actively monitors all running
            processes, tracking metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption,
            uptime, and others. It also restarts processes if they crash,
            ensuring your application remains live.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="2-logging-and-output-management">
          2. <strong>Logging and Output Management:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PM2 collects both standard output (<code>stdout</code>) and error
            output (<code>stderr</code>) from each process it manages.
          </li>
          <li>
            These logs are stored in log files (located in
            <code>~/.pm2/logs</code>) for each application. PM2 also provides
            commands like <code>pm2 logs</code> to view live logs of all
            processes.
          </li>
          <li>PM2 also supports log rotation to avoid oversized log files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="3-cluster-mode-and-load-balancing">
          3. <strong>Cluster Mode and Load Balancing:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In <strong>cluster mode</strong>, PM2 can automatically load-balance
            incoming traffic across the multiple instances of your app. This is
            particularly useful in Node.js applications where the event loop
            runs on a single thread and doesn't naturally utilize all CPU cores.
          </li>
          <li>
            PM2 uses Node’s <code>cluster</code> module to fork a number of
            worker processes. These worker processes all listen on the same
            port, and the operating system load balances incoming requests among
            them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="4-startup-scripts-and-auto-startup">
          4. <strong>Startup Scripts and Auto-Startup:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PM2 can generate startup scripts to launch your applications when
            the system restarts. It does this using system tools like
            <code>systemd</code> or <code>upstart</code> to integrate with the
            system's init process.
          </li>
          <li>
            The command <code>pm2 startup</code> generates the necessary script,
            and <code>pm2 save</code> persists the current process list to be
            restored on startup.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="5-configuration-and-ecosystem-files">
          5. <strong>Configuration and Ecosystem Files:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PM2 allows you to define application configurations via
            <code>ecosystem.config.js</code> (or JSON/YAML formats). This file
            allows you to specify the script to run, environment variables,
            cluster settings, number of instances, and other configurations.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can easily start multiple applications or configure complex
            setups with a single command (<code
              >pm2 start ecosystem.config.js</code
            >).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="6-watch-and-reload">6. <strong>Watch and Reload:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PM2 provides the ability to watch for file changes in your
            application and automatically restart the application when changes
            are detected. This is useful during development, but also in
            production for real-time application updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is done using a file watcher that monitors the directory for
            changes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="7-process-monitoring-and-metrics">
          7. <strong>Process Monitoring and Metrics:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PM2 collects statistics about the processes it manages, such as
            memory usage, CPU usage, and process state. This information is
            displayed with commands like <code>pm2 list</code>,
            <code>pm2 monit</code>, and <code>pm2 status</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            PM2 also has integrations for external monitoring platforms like
            Keymetrics, which provide more in-depth analysis and insights.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="8-zero-downtime-reloads">
          8. <strong>Zero-Downtime Reloads:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            One of PM2's most important features is its support for
            <strong>zero-downtime reloads</strong>. When updating an app (for
            instance, deploying new code), PM2 can reload the application
            without causing downtime. This works by sending signals to each
            process to reload, ensuring that new processes are spun up while the
            old ones are gracefully shut down.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="9-process-lifecycle-management">
          9. <strong>Process Lifecycle Management:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PM2 offers several commands to manage processes’ lifecycles, such
            as:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>pm2 start &lt;app&gt;</code> to start an application.
              </li>
              <li><code>pm2 stop &lt;app&gt;</code> to stop an application.</li>
              <li>
                <code>pm2 restart &lt;app&gt;</code> to restart an app, which
                can be done gracefully.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>pm2 delete &lt;app&gt;</code> to remove an app from PM2’s
                process list.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="10-watchdog--restart-mechanism">
          10. <strong>Watchdog &amp; Restart Mechanism:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PM2 monitors the health of your processes, ensuring they are always
            running. If any application crashes or fails, PM2 automatically
            restarts it based on the configured settings (default is unlimited
            restarts).
          </li>
          <li>
            PM2 also supports setting memory or CPU limits, and it can restart
            the app if those limits are breached.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="11-cluster-management-and-sticky-sessions">
          11. <strong>Cluster Management and Sticky Sessions:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In <strong>cluster mode</strong>, PM2 can handle sticky sessions
            (for stateful applications). It routes requests from the same client
            to the same worker process, ensuring that session information is
            maintained across requests.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In essence, PM2 abstracts the complexities of managing Node.js
          applications in production, offering easy-to-use tools for monitoring,
          logging, process clustering, and zero-downtime restarts. It enables
          developers to focus more on building applications while leaving the
          process management and reliability concerns to PM2.

      </div>
      <div class="bubble">

          PM2 primarily uses
          <strong>Node's <code>cluster</code> module</strong> to manage multiple
          processes, but it also leverages <strong>child processes</strong> in
          certain situations. Here's how each one fits into PM2’s architecture:

            Utilization)</strong
          >
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PM2 uses Node's built-in <code>cluster</code> module to fork
            multiple worker processes (also known as worker threads) from a
            master process. This is done to fully utilize the multi-core
            capabilities of the server.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How it works</strong>: The master process created by PM2
            manages and coordinates the worker processes. Each worker process
            runs an instance of your Node.js app, and all of them listen on the
            same port. The operating system or Node.js handles load balancing
            between these worker processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Why it uses the cluster module</strong>: The cluster module
            is designed to allow a Node.js application to spawn multiple child
            processes (workers), which can run on different CPU cores. Since
            Node.js runs on a single thread (event loop), using clusters allows
            you to leverage multiple cores for parallelism.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="2-child-process-for-non-nodejs-workloads">
          2. <strong>Child Process (For Non-Node.js Workloads)</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            PM2 also uses Node's <code>child_process</code> module, particularly
            for certain management tasks. For example, if you need to run a
            non-Node.js script or a separate process (e.g., a shell script or an
            external application), PM2 can use <code>child_process</code> to
            spawn and manage these tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How it works</strong>: When an app or script is executed via
            <code>pm2 start</code>, PM2 spawns a child process for that app. For
            instance, if you are running a script written in another language or
            if you want to manage background tasks, PM2 might use
            <code>child_process.spawn()</code> or
            <code>child_process.fork()</code> to handle those.
          </li>

        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>PM2 doesn't directly rely on Worker Threads</strong> for
            multi-core parallelism, but there are cases where PM2 might use
            Node’s <code>worker_threads</code> module internally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Worker Threads</strong> are used to run JavaScript code in
            parallel within the same process, and they are more lightweight
            compared to spawning full child processes. However, PM2's main focus
            is on process-level management using the
            <code>cluster</code> module, as it provides better scalability for
            Node.js applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>When they might be used</strong>: In situations where a
            specific task in an app requires parallelism but doesn't need to be
            split into separate processes, PM2 might make use of worker threads.

            <strong>Cluster Module</strong>: The core of PM2's process
            management for running multiple worker processes across different
            CPU cores.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Child Process</strong>: Used for managing other processes
            (e.g., running scripts, background tasks).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Worker Threads</strong>: PM2 may use this module in specific
            cases where multi-threading within a single process is beneficial,
            but it’s not the primary tool for multi-core scaling.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In most scenarios, PM2 relies on the
          <strong>cluster module</strong> to fork processes and utilize multiple
          cores, ensuring high availability and load balancing across the app
          instances.

          Yes, each fork of the <strong>cluster module</strong> in Node.js is

          How Node's Cluster Module Distributes Processes Across CPU Cores:
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Forking Worker Processes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When you use the
                <strong><code>cluster.fork()</code></strong> method in Node.js
                (or PM2 does this automatically when you run in cluster mode),
                the master process spawns multiple worker processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                These worker processes are separate
                <strong>Node.js instances</strong> running in parallel, and each
                instance runs its own <strong>event loop</strong>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Operating System Scheduling:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The operating system’s <strong>process scheduler</strong> then
                determines on which CPU core each of these worker processes will
                run. The operating system usually tries to place them across
                available cores to make use of the machine’s multi-core
                architecture.
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, on a machine with 4 cores, Node.js (through the
                cluster module) can spawn 4 worker processes, and the OS will
                assign each of those workers to a different CPU core (assuming
                the system has enough resources and there's no load imbalance).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Default Behavior in Cluster Mode:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                By default, if you start your Node.js application with
                <code>pm2 start &lt;app&gt; -i max</code>, PM2 will fork as many
                worker processes as there are CPU cores on the machine (<code
                  >max</code
                >
                means to use the maximum available cores).
              </li>
              <li>
                If you specify a number, such as
                <code>pm2 start &lt;app&gt; -i 4</code>, it will spawn exactly 4
                worker processes, and the OS will spread them across the cores.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Benefits of Multi-Core Usage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Each worker process is independent and can handle a different
                request or perform a task in parallel. This is especially useful
                for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy computation) where Node’s
                single-threaded nature could become a bottleneck. By using
                multiple processes, Node.js can take advantage of multi-core
                systems and provide better scalability and performance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Cluster vs. Single Process (Single Core):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you run your app without the <code>cluster</code> module or
                without PM2’s cluster mode, Node.js runs on a single process,

            <strong>Shared State</strong>: Worker processes do not share state.
            Communication between them must be done through message passing
            (using <code>process.send()</code> or a shared resource like a
            database). This makes them more fault-tolerant (one worker can crash

          Each fork created by Node’s
          <strong><code>cluster</code></strong> module (and consequently by PM2
          when running in cluster mode) will, in most cases, be scheduled to run
          on a <strong>different CPU core</strong> by the operating system. This
          allows Node.js to scale across multi-core machines and fully utilize
          the system's CPU resources.

            When you call <code>cluster.fork()</code>, Node.js will still create
            the specified number of worker processes (e.g.,
            <code>cluster.fork()</code> can be called multiple times for each

          <li>
            For a single-core CPU, if you fork, for example,
            <strong>4 worker processes</strong>, you will have 4 independent
            processes, each running its own event loop. However, only
            <strong>one of them</strong> can be executing on the CPU at any

          <li>
            On a <strong>single-core system</strong>, the
            <strong>operating system's scheduler</strong> will alternate between
            the worker processes. This is called
            <strong>time-slicing</strong> or <strong>context switching</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The OS will rapidly switch between the workers, allowing each worker
            to run for a short period before moving to the next one. This
            happens so quickly that it appears as though all the workers are
            running in parallel, but in reality, only one worker is executing at
            any given moment.

        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Context switching</strong> allows the operating system to
            simulate parallelism on a single-core CPU, but it comes with
            overhead. Each time the CPU switches from one worker process to
            another, the operating system needs to save the state of the current
            process and load the state of the next one. This context switch can
            introduce some <strong>performance overhead</strong>, especially if
            there are many workers or the tasks are resource-intensive.
          </li>
          <li>
            For lightweight, I/O-bound tasks, this might not be a big deal, and
            the system can still handle multiple processes relatively
            efficiently. However, for CPU-bound tasks, this overhead can reduce
            the benefits of forking multiple workers, as the single CPU core can
            only process one worker at a time.

        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Limited Concurrency</strong>: Since only one worker process
            can execute on a single CPU core at a time, the overall throughput
            of the application could be limited. The more workers you create,
            the more time is spent switching between them, and less time is
            spent actually executing tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increased Overhead</strong>: As the number of workers
            increases on a single-core CPU, the time spent on context switching
            (which involves saving and restoring the state of each process) can
            become significant, and this could lead to worse performance
            compared to just running a single process.

          5. <strong>How It Impacts Performance:</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On a <strong>single-core machine</strong>, running multiple
            processes is not as advantageous as on multi-core systems, since all
            processes share the same core. You’re still limited by the CPU’s
            ability to process one task at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your application is <strong>I/O-bound</strong> (waiting for
            database queries, network requests, etc.), running multiple
            processes can still improve responsiveness because the system can
            handle blocking I/O operations in one process while another is doing
            work.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, for <strong>CPU-bound</strong> applications, running
            multiple workers on a single-core CPU may not provide significant
            performance gains and could even hurt performance due to the
            overhead of switching between processes.

          <li>
            On single-core systems, it is generally better to limit the number
            of worker processes to a small number (1 or 2), because adding more
            workers would just increase the overhead from context switching
            without a corresponding benefit in processing power.
          </li>
          <li>
            For CPU-bound tasks, consider optimizing the single process or using
            techniques like <strong>worker threads</strong> (introduced in
            Node.js 10.x) to achieve better concurrency within a single process.

          <li>
            Node.js provides several methods to create child processes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong><code>child_process.spawn()</code></strong
                >: This is used to launch a new process with a given command. It
                allows for more control over the process's input/output streams.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><code>child_process.exec()</code></strong

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><code>child_process.fork()</code></strong
                >: This is a specialized version of <code>spawn()</code> for
                spawning new Node.js processes. It is commonly used for spawning
                child processes in a Node.js application and allows for
                communication between the parent and child processes through
                inter-process communication (IPC).

        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Once a child process is created, the operating system schedules it
            to run on an available CPU core.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you are running on a <strong>multi-core system</strong>, the
                operating system may assign the child process to a separate
                core, allowing parallel execution of tasks. However,
                <strong>on a single-core system</strong>, the OS will switch
                between the parent and child processes, using
                <strong>context switching</strong>.

          <li>
            Child processes are <strong>isolated</strong> from the parent
            process in terms of memory and event loop. They run in their own
            independent environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The parent process has control over the child process but does not
            share its event loop. The child process has its own event loop and
            can handle asynchronous operations independently of the parent

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>IPC (Inter-Process Communication)</strong>: Node.js allows
            communication between the parent and child processes through IPC.
            This is done using:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong><code>child_process.send()</code></strong

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Standard Input/Output</strong>: You can also communicate
                through the child’s standard input (<code>stdin</code>), output
                (<code>stdout</code>), and error (<code>stderr</code>) streams.
                For example, using <code>spawn()</code>, the parent can pipe
                data to the child’s <code>stdin</code> or listen to data from
                the child’s <code>stdout</code>.
              </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Example</strong>: With <code>fork()</code>, Node.js
            automatically sets up an IPC channel between the parent and child
            process. This allows the parent to send data to the child, and the
            child to send data back to the parent.

            task asynchronously in parallel. After the task completes, the child
            process exits, and the parent can handle the exit event.
          </li>
          <li>
            The child process can send an exit code to indicate success or
            failure. The parent can listen to the <code>exit</code> event to
            determine when the child process has finished.

          <li>
            <strong>Isolation</strong>: Child processes are isolated from the

            parent is unaffected. This isolation can be helpful for handling
            tasks that might fail or need to be restarted without affecting the
            main application.

          <li>
            <strong>Parallelism</strong>: On multi-core systems, child processes

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Functions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You cannot send JavaScript functions via
                <code>child.send()</code> because functions cannot be serialized
                or deserialized (stringified and parsed back) in a way that
                would make them functional on the receiving end.
              </li>

          How Does <code>child.send()</code> Work?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The data you send with <code>child.send()</code> is
            <strong>serialized</strong> into a format that can be transmitted
            over the IPC channel (typically JSON serialization). The child
            process then <strong>deserializes</strong> the data back into
            JavaScript objects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since the parent and child processes are separate, each has its own
            memory space. The IPC system ensures that data is copied between the
            processes, rather than being directly shared in memory.

          Example of Sending and Receiving Data:

        <p>
          Here’s an example where the parent process sends a message to the
          child, and the child process responds:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Parent Process (<code>parent.js</code>):</strong></p>

          <li>
            The child listens for messages from the parent, processes the data,
            and sends a response back to the parent using
            <code>process.send()</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
        <p>
          You can send a variety of
          <strong>serializable data types</strong> between parent and child

        </p>
        <ul>

          <li><code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code></li>

        <p>
          However, you cannot send functions, circular references, or some
          complex non-serializable objects. Data is serialized into JSON format
          and passed through the IPC channel between the parent and child
          processes.

            <ul>
              <li>
                The <strong>master process</strong> manages the worker
                processes. It can send messages to individual workers using the
                <code>worker.send()</code> method, and workers can send messages
                back to the master process via the
                <code>process.send()</code> method.
              </li>
              <li>
                Workers do
                <strong>not communicate directly with each other</strong>
                through IPC; instead, they communicate with the master process,
                which can forward messages between workers if needed.

                The communication between the master and workers, and between
                workers and the master, is done through an
                <strong>IPC channel</strong>. You can send JavaScript objects
                (which are serializable) between processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each worker has its own <code>process.send()</code> method to
                send messages to the master process.

  });
}</code></pre>
        <h3 id="how-this-works">How This Works:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <strong>master process</strong> forks multiple worker processes
            (equal to the number of CPU cores, in this case).
          </li>
          <li>
            Each worker sends an initial message to the master process using
            <code>process.send()</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The master process listens for messages from the workers and can
            forward messages to other workers.
          </li>
          <li>
            In this example, when the master receives a message from worker 1,
            it forwards that message to worker 2 using
            <code>cluster.workers[2].send()</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Note</strong>: Workers communicate with the master process,
            which is responsible for forwarding messages to other workers.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Master-Worker Communication</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The master process can send messages to specific workers using
                <code>worker.send()</code> and listen for messages using
                <code>worker.on('message', callback)</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The master can broadcast a message to all workers by looping
                through <code>cluster.workers</code> and sending messages to
                each worker.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Worker-Worker Communication via Master</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Direct communication between workers is not supported out of the
                box. If one worker needs to send data to another, it sends a
                message to the master, and the master forwards it to the
                appropriate worker.
              </li>
              <li>
                This pattern of "master relaying messages" is essential when you
                need to coordinate multiple workers.

            </ul>
          </li>

            <p><strong>Serializing Data</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Like with child processes, the data exchanged via the IPC
                channel is serialized (usually via JSON). You can send any
                serializable JavaScript objects (e.g., arrays, objects,
                primitive types) between workers and the master.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Handling Failures</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If a worker crashes or becomes unresponsive, the master process
                can handle it. You can set up logic in the master to restart
                workers if necessary (using <code>cluster.fork()</code> again).
                You can also handle worker crashes and restart them
                automatically with PM2.

          The <strong><code>worker_threads</code></strong> module in Node.js
          provides a way to create <strong>multi-threaded</strong> JavaScript
          applications. Unlike the <strong><code>cluster</code> module</strong>,
          which creates multiple processes to take advantage of multi-core
          systems, the <code>worker_threads</code> module creates
          <strong>threads</strong> within a single process, allowing for
          <strong>parallel execution</strong> within the same Node.js process.

                The <code>worker_threads</code> module allows you to run code in

                processes. This is different from the
                <code>cluster</code> module, which spawns separate processes.

              <li>
                Each worker runs in its own isolated
                <strong>JavaScript environment</strong> (with its own event
                loop, memory, and stack), but shares the same memory heap with
                the parent thread, making it more efficient than creating
                multiple processes.

              <li>
                The <code>worker_threads</code> module is particularly useful
                for <strong>CPU-bound tasks</strong> (such as heavy computations
                or data processing) because it allows Node.js to make use of

                This is crucial in Node.js since it is single-threaded by

        <p>
          When you use <code>worker_threads</code>, you create threads that run
          alongside the main thread (the "main" or "parent" thread). Each worker
          thread can communicate with the main thread using the
          <strong>postMessage</strong> and <strong>onmessage</strong> mechanism.

                In the <code>main.js</code>, a worker is created using

                If you have a <strong>single CPU core</strong>, then all threads

                They will

                instead <strong>share the processing time</strong> of the CPU
                core, with the operating system scheduling the threads to run.
              </li>
              <li>
                The threads will still execute <strong>concurrently</strong>,
                but because there’s only one core, the CPU will switch between
                the threads, giving the illusion of parallel execution (this is

              <li>
                If you want to make use of multiple cores, you would need to

                handle I/O operations, which is particularly useful in Node.js

          Practical Example on Single CPU Core:

        <p>
          In a <strong>single-core system</strong>, when you create multiple
          workers using <code>worker_threads</code>, the system will still only
          have one core to execute all of them. The threads will take turns
          executing in quick succession, giving the appearance of parallelism.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code class="js language-js">const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

const worker1 = new Worker('./worker.js');
const worker2 = new Worker('./worker.js');

worker1.on('message', (msg) =&gt; {
  console.log('Worker 1 finished:', msg);
});

worker2.on('message', (msg) =&gt; {
  console.log('Worker 2 finished:', msg);
});</code></pre>
        <p>
          If you're running this on a <strong>single-core CPU</strong>, the
          operating system will quickly switch between <code>worker1</code> and
          <code>worker2</code> as they perform their tasks. It will not be true
          parallel execution, but <strong>concurrent execution</strong> within
          the single core.

          Parallel Execution on Multi-Core CPUs:
        </h3>
        <p>
          On a multi-core CPU, the operating system can allocate threads to
          different cores, so each thread can truly run in parallel on a
          separate core. However, as mentioned before, Node.js doesn't
          automatically distribute threads across multiple cores. You would need
          to create separate worker threads or processes (using the
          <code>worker_threads</code> or <code>cluster</code> module) and have
          them explicitly run on different CPU cores.

        <ul>
          <li>
            On a <strong>single-core CPU</strong>, threads created by the
            <code>worker_threads</code> module run concurrently, but not in
            parallel. They share the CPU core, and the operating system manages
            switching between them.
          </li>
          <li>
            On a <strong>multi-core CPU</strong>, threads can potentially be
            distributed across multiple cores, but this requires careful setup.
            If you need to take full advantage of multi-core systems, you can
            use a combination of the <code>worker_threads</code> module and the
            <code>cluster</code> module or manually manage thread distribution
            across cores.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So, <strong>within a single process</strong>, when you create worker

          Yes, if you are running multiple threads on a

          <code>worker_threads</code> module will execute on
          <strong>different threads of the same CPU core</strong>. Here’s how it

            <p><strong>Threads Sharing a Single CPU Core</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On a single-core CPU, there is only one physical core capable of
                executing instructions at any given moment.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you create multiple threads (using
                <code>worker_threads</code>), the operating system's
                <strong>scheduler</strong> manages
                <strong>time-slicing</strong> between the threads, allowing each
                thread to execute for a fraction of time before switching to the
                next thread.
              </li>
              <li>
                This switching happens so fast (usually in milliseconds) that it
                appears as though the threads are running simultaneously, but in
                reality, they are taking turns on the same CPU core.
              </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Concurrency vs. Parallelism</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Concurrency</strong>: Multiple threads are in progress
                at the same time, but only one thread is actually executing at
                any moment (due to sharing the same CPU core). This is what
                happens on a single-core CPU.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Parallelism</strong>: Multiple threads execute truly in
                parallel, each on its own CPU core. This requires a multi-core
                CPU.

            <p><strong>How Threads Operate</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Each thread has its own
                <strong>execution context</strong> (stack, program counter, and
                registers) but shares the same
                <strong>process memory space</strong> with other threads.
              </li>
              <li>
                On a single-core CPU, the CPU core switches between threads to
                simulate parallelism, which introduces
                <strong>context-switching overhead</strong>. This can slightly
                reduce performance if the workload involves many threads and
                frequent switching.

            <ul>
              <li>
                In Node.js, when you create a worker thread using the
                <code>worker_threads</code> module, it runs in its own thread
                within the same process.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you create multiple worker threads on a single-core system,
                they share the CPU core and execute one after the other, with
                the operating system controlling the scheduling.

                After a certain time slice (e.g., a few milliseconds), the CPU

          How This Affects Worker Threads in Node.js:
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Single-Core CPUs</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On a <strong>single-core CPU</strong>, only one thread can be
                active on the CPU core at any given moment. Even if you create
                multiple worker threads in Node.js, they will
                <strong>take turns</strong> using the single core (through
                time-slicing).
              </li>
              <li>
                If the CPU is not <strong>multi-threaded</strong> (i.e., no
                Hyper-Threading), then it can run only
                <strong>one thread per core</strong>, and you will experience
                <strong>concurrent execution</strong> but not parallel
                execution.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <p><strong>Multi-Core CPUs</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On a <strong>multi-core CPU</strong>, Node.js worker threads (or
                processes) can run
                <strong>concurrently on different cores</strong>. Each core can
                execute a separate thread or process, allowing true parallel
                execution.
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, with 4 cores and 8 threads (due to SMT), you could
                run 8 threads in parallel, where each thread is executed
                simultaneously by a different core.
              </li>

            <p><strong>Hyper-Threading (SMT)</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you have a CPU with <strong>Hyper-Threading</strong> (like
                Intel's processors), each physical core can execute
                <strong>2 threads concurrently</strong> (or sometimes more,
                depending on the CPU).
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, on an
                <strong>8-core processor with Hyper-Threading</strong>, you
                would have <strong>16 logical threads</strong> (8 physical cores
                × 2 threads per core), which can be run concurrently on the CPU.

            <p><strong>CPU and Threads</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A <strong>CPU core</strong> can handle multiple threads, but it
                can only
                <strong>actively execute one thread at a time</strong> on that

                <strong>threads are switched rapidly</strong> to simulate
                concurrency.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Single-Core CPU</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On a <strong>single-core CPU</strong>, there’s just one core, so
                only <strong>one thread</strong> can execute at a time on that
                core. If there are multiple threads, they will be executed
                <strong>sequentially</strong> using
                <strong>time-slicing</strong>, where the CPU rapidly switches
                between threads, creating the appearance of parallelism.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Multi-Core CPU</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On a <strong>multi-core CPU</strong>, each core can handle
                <strong>one thread at a time</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                But if the CPU supports
                <strong>Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)</strong>, like
                <strong>Intel's Hyper-Threading</strong>, then each core can
                handle <strong>two or more threads concurrently</strong>.
                However, even with SMT, each thread still
                <strong>takes turns</strong> using the core’s resources. The CPU
                doesn't literally run all threads at the same exact time on a
                single core but makes use of idle resources on each core to
                handle multiple threads more efficiently.

            <p><strong>What Happens on Multi-Core CPUs</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                With a <strong>multi-core processor</strong>, you can run
                multiple threads <strong>in parallel</strong> — one thread per
                core.
              </li>
              <li>
                The threads run on separate cores, allowing
                <strong>true parallelism</strong> where each thread executes
                independently of the others.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, even if each core can only run one thread at a time,
                with <strong>multiple cores</strong>, you can run
                <strong>multiple threads simultaneously</strong>.
              </li>

          </li>

            <p><strong>Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In CPUs with <strong>Hyper-Threading</strong> (like Intel CPUs),
                <strong>each core can handle two threads simultaneously</strong>
                by quickly switching between them. This allows better
                utilization of the core, especially for tasks that are
                <strong>I/O-bound</strong> or
                <strong>lightly computational</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, SMT does not <strong>double the performance</strong> —
                it just optimizes the use of resources when one thread is
                waiting for I/O or is otherwise idle.

            <ul>
              <li>
                By default, Node.js is <strong>single-threaded</strong>, meaning
                it runs on a <strong>single thread</strong> that handles all
                incoming I/O requests (such as HTTP requests, file operations,
                etc.) in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner.
              </li>
              <li>
                This <strong>event loop</strong> is managed by a single thread,
                and Node.js
                <strong

                >
                on multiple CPU cores within this loop.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Node.js provides the
                <strong><code>worker_threads</code></strong> module, which
                allows you to spawn additional threads within your application.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each <strong>worker thread</strong> is essentially a separate
                instance running in its own thread, and you can use this to take
                advantage of multiple cores by creating multiple worker threads.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, Node.js does not manage
                <strong>context switching between these worker threads</strong>
                at the hardware level. The <strong>operating system</strong> is
                responsible for managing which thread runs on which core and
                handling context switching between threads on
                <strong>different cores</strong>.

            <ul>

                Node.js itself does
                <strong
                  >not automatically spread tasks across multiple cores</strong
                >. If you want to take advantage of multiple CPU cores in
                Node.js, you need to use <strong>cluster</strong> or
                <strong>worker threads</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <strong>Cluster module</strong> allows you to spawn child
                processes (which run on separate cores) and share server ports
                among them, but these are <strong>separate processes</strong>,
                not threads.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Worker threads</strong> can run on separate cores if
                your machine has them, but the operating system scheduler
                decides which core to assign each thread, not Node.js.

                they're on the same core or different cores).
              </li>
              <li>
                The OS's scheduler decides when and where each thread (whether
                from Node.js or any other process) runs, and it can move threads
                between different CPU cores to balance load.

          The <strong><code>worker_threads</code></strong> module in Node.js

          can <strong>run on different cores</strong> (if the system has more
          than one core) because it relies on the operating system to manage the
          scheduling of threads across available CPU cores.

                When you create worker threads using the
                <strong><code>worker_threads</code></strong> module in Node.js,
                each worker is a <strong>separate thread</strong> running within
                the same Node.js process.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <strong>operating system</strong> (OS) is responsible for
                deciding which core the worker thread should run on.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have a <strong>multi-core CPU</strong>, the OS might
                assign each worker thread to a different core (depending on the
                system's load balancing and scheduler), allowing for
                <strong>parallel execution</strong> on multiple cores.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, the worker threads are
                <strong>not guaranteed</strong> to run on different cores. The
                OS might place them on the <strong>same core</strong> if there
                are fewer physical cores or if the system is under heavy load.

            <ul>
              <li>
                If you are running Node.js on a
                <strong>single-core CPU</strong>, the
                <strong>worker threads</strong> will still execute on the
                <strong>same core</strong> because there is only one available
                core.
              </li>
              <li>
                In this case, the OS will manage the time-slicing between
                threads, and it will give each thread a fraction of the CPU time
                in a manner that appears concurrent, but only one thread will
                actually be running at any given moment on that core.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Thread Scheduling</strong>: When you spawn worker
                threads in Node.js, the
                <strong>OS's thread scheduler</strong> decides which physical
                core (or logical core, if you have Hyper-Threading) the threads
                should run on. This is true regardless of whether you're using
                <code>worker_threads</code> in Node.js or threads from other
                programming environments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Multi-Core Systems</strong>: On a multi-core CPU, the OS
                has more flexibility to schedule threads across cores, which
                could result in workers running on
                <strong>different cores</strong> if there are enough threads and
                CPU cores.

          <li>
            <strong>No</strong>, worker threads in Node.js are not confined to
            the <strong>same core</strong>. The OS decides where each worker
            thread runs, and it may be scheduled on different cores if there are

          <li>
            On a <strong>multi-core CPU</strong>, the worker threads

            <p><strong>Worker Threads and Parallelism</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Each <strong>worker thread</strong> is executed in its own
                <strong>separate thread</strong>, and if these threads are
                assigned to <strong>different CPU cores</strong> by the
                operating system, they can
                <strong>run simultaneously</strong> on those cores.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is <strong>true parallelism</strong> because multiple
                threads are executed <strong>at the same time</strong>, each on

            <p><strong>How the OS Manages Parallelism</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On a <strong>multi-core system</strong>, the
                <strong>operating system scheduler</strong> decides which core
                each worker thread will run on. If there are multiple threads
                and enough available cores, the OS can distribute the workload
                across different cores, allowing for
                <strong>parallel execution</strong> of the worker threads.
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, on a <strong>4-core CPU</strong>, if you create
                <strong>4 worker threads</strong>, the OS might assign each
                thread to a <strong>different core</strong>, and those threads
                will run <strong>simultaneously</strong>, utilizing the full
                parallel processing power of the CPU.

            When <strong>worker threads</strong> are distributed across multiple

            This allows Node.js to take full advantage of

          <strong>SMT (Simultaneous Multithreading)</strong>, like
          <strong>Intel’s Hyper-Threading</strong>, allows a
          <strong>single CPU core</strong> to handle
          <strong>multiple threads</strong> at the
          <strong>same time</strong> (or rather, to handle multiple threads
          <strong>concurrently</strong>, utilizing the resources of a single
          core more efficiently).

        <p>
          Even though a <strong>CPU core</strong> can
          <strong>only execute one thread at a time</strong>, a core in an
          SMT-enabled processor can run
          <strong>multiple threads concurrently</strong> by
          <strong>sharing the core's resources</strong>. This doesn’t mean the
          threads are executed at the same time (in parallel) but that the core
          is able to <strong>quickly switch between threads</strong> and use its
          resources more efficiently. This can lead to
          <strong>better overall utilization of the core</strong>.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Without SMT</strong>: A single core executes only
                <strong>one thread</strong> at a time. If you have multiple
                threads, they must <strong>time-slice</strong> to take turns
                using the core.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>With SMT</strong>: A single core can
                <strong>handle two (or more) threads at once</strong>, but not
                simultaneously. The threads share the resources of the core,
                allowing the core to handle multiple tasks
                <strong>more efficiently</strong>.

            <ul>
              <li>
                A core has resources like
                <strong>ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units)</strong>,
                <strong>registers</strong>, <strong>caches</strong>, etc. With
                SMT, these resources are shared between threads. When one thread
                is waiting (for example, waiting for I/O), the core can use the
                available resources to run another thread, improving efficiency
                and <strong>reducing idle time</strong>.
              </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Not True Parallelism</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                SMT does <strong>not</strong> allow a core to run two threads
                <strong>in parallel</strong> at the exact same time. It's more
                like <strong>pseudo-parallelism</strong>, where the core
                switches between threads so quickly that it seems like both are
                running at the same time.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is why SMT can improve the throughput of the core, but it
                does not <strong>double the performance</strong>. Instead, it
                utilizes resources that would otherwise be underutilized.

              will get a smaller slice of the core’s resources. If one thread is
              not using all the core's resources (perhaps it's waiting for I/O),
              the other thread can use those idle resources, improving

          SMT (Simultaneous Multithreading) handles multiple threads without

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>SMT</strong> enables a single CPU core to manage multiple
              threads <strong>simultaneously</strong>, by allowing them to
              <strong>share the core’s execution resources</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                These resources include things like
                <strong>Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs)</strong>,
                <strong>registers</strong>, <strong>cache memory</strong>, and
                other functional units.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Without SMT</strong>, only one thread uses these
                resources at any given time, while <strong>SMT</strong> allows
                two or more threads to share the same resources, increasing the
                core's efficiency.

            <p>
              <strong>Multiple threads (e.g., two threads)</strong> can be
              <strong>executed concurrently</strong>, but
              <strong>not truly in parallel</strong>. Each thread doesn't get
              its own dedicated resources; instead, the core
              <strong>interleaves the execution</strong> of both threads by
              rapidly switching between them, leveraging idle parts of the core.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              SMT doesn't require <strong>time-slicing</strong> in the
              traditional sense. In a typical time-slice system (like the OS
              scheduler switching between processes), the operating system
              preemptively allocates time to each thread or process. However,
              SMT works by allowing
              <strong
                >multiple threads to be processed in parallel within the same
                clock cycle</strong
              >
              using the core’s multiple functional units.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Here’s the basic idea:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The core’s resources (ALUs, caches, etc.) are
                <strong>divided up</strong> between the threads. This is not
                <strong>time-slicing</strong> because the threads are
                <strong>using the core’s resources concurrently</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                While <strong>one thread</strong> may be waiting for data (e.g.,
                waiting on a memory access), the core can use its unused
                resources to execute <strong>another thread</strong>. In
                essence, the two threads share the core’s resources, but
                <strong>both threads are being processed</strong>
                <strong>at the same time</strong>, although in a very
                <strong>interleaved manner</strong>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          3. <strong>No Full Time-Slicing in SMT</strong>:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In traditional <strong>time-slicing</strong>, the CPU will allocate
            a small time slice (e.g., 1-10ms) to one thread, then switch to
            another thread, and so on. This gives the illusion of parallel
            execution even though the CPU is only processing one thread at a
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, in <strong>SMT</strong>, the threads share the resources
            <strong>within each clock cycle</strong>, meaning that instead of
            waiting for the next time slice to execute, both threads can be
            processed concurrently <strong>within the same cycle</strong>,
            without waiting for the other thread to "finish" its time slice.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For instance, the <strong>ALU</strong> of the core might be
                executing operations from <strong>Thread 1</strong>, while the
                <strong>FPU (Floating Point Unit)</strong> might be executing
                operations for <strong>Thread 2</strong>, effectively allowing
                both to progress concurrently within the same cycle.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>SMT cores</strong> are designed with
            <strong>multiple pipelines</strong> or execution units that can
            handle different aspects of thread execution simultaneously. A core
            with SMT can have multiple <strong>logical processors</strong> per
            physical core, each executing its own instruction stream
            concurrently, but sharing the actual execution resources of the
            core.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modern <strong>SMT implementations</strong> usually allow
            <strong>two threads per core</strong> (but some designs can handle
            more), and the <strong>hardware</strong> can intelligently switch
            between threads based on resource availability. If one thread is
            stalled (waiting for data or memory), the other thread can continue
            running and make use of the core's resources.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You now have <strong>8 logical cores</strong>, and the threads
            within each physical core are <strong>interleaved</strong> across
            the core’s resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thread 1</strong> could be using the

          <li>
            SMT allows <strong>concurrent execution</strong> of multiple threads
            <strong>within the same time slice</strong>, but it doesn’t require

            <strong>share the core’s execution resources</strong> (ALU, FPU,
            caches) <strong>concurrently</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Each thread gets a slice of the core’s resources</strong>,
            but the threads don’t have to wait for a full time slice to complete
            before another thread runs; they <strong>interleave</strong> across
            the core’s functional units, which allows them to progress
            concurrently within the same clock cycle.

          more efficiently?

          Yes, exactly! <strong>SMT (Simultaneous Multithreading)</strong> is
          designed to make more efficient use of the resources within a
          <strong>single CPU core</strong> by allowing it to handle
          <strong>multiple threads concurrently</strong>. It doesn't provide
          true parallelism (like running multiple threads on multiple CPU
          cores), but it optimizes the execution of multiple threads on a single
          core.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Efficiency Improvement</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>SMT improves the efficiency</strong> of a CPU core by
                enabling it to handle more than one thread at a time. It allows
                the core’s <strong>resources</strong> (such as its ALU,
                registers, floating-point units, and cache) to be utilized more
                effectively, especially when one thread might be stalled (e.g.,
                waiting for memory or data).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Without SMT</strong>, a single-threaded workload would
                leave some resources idle, as only one thread can use them at a
                time. SMT minimizes this wastage by allowing
                <strong>multiple threads</strong> to make progress using those
                resources, even if one thread is waiting for something (like
                data).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Concurrency, Not Parallelism</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>SMT allows for concurrency</strong> by giving multiple
                threads a chance to run on the same core, but they
                <strong>don’t run in true parallel</strong> (as in separate
                cores). Instead, the core <strong>interleaves</strong> the
                execution of threads within its available execution units. This
                makes the best use of the core's resources but doesn't mean both
                threads are running at exactly the same time (in parallel).
              </li>
              <li>
                Think of it as
                <strong>"multi-tasking" on a single core</strong>, where
                different threads share the CPU's execution resources but do not
                necessarily run in parallel.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In a <strong>2-thread SMT configuration</strong>, each CPU core
                can handle two threads. If <strong>Thread 1</strong> is waiting
                for data (say, a memory load), the
                <strong>second thread (Thread 2)</strong> can use the idle
                execution units of the core to continue doing useful work. This
                <strong>minimizes idle time</strong> and maximizes throughput,
                but <strong>Thread 1</strong> and <strong>Thread 2</strong> are
                not executing at the exact same time. Instead, the core
                <strong>switches between them</strong> quickly, leveraging idle
                resources.

            <p><strong>Limitations</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                SMT does not allow threads to run in true parallel (across
                multiple cores or independent execution units). It simply allows
                better
                <strong>utilization of the resources of a single core</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                It <strong>does not double the performance</strong> of a core.
                Typically, SMT offers
                <strong>moderate improvements</strong> (like 20-30% better
                throughput) but does not double the processing power of a core.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Smarter Resource Utilization</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The primary goal of SMT is to keep the core
                <strong>busy</strong> by executing
                <strong>multiple threads</strong> in a way that utilizes the
                core’s resources more efficiently. When a thread is idle or
                waiting, the other thread can keep the core busy, thus improving
                overall system throughput without the need for more physical
                cores.

        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>
          SMT is a way to improve the
          <strong>efficiency of a single CPU core</strong> by allowing it to run
          multiple threads <strong>concurrently</strong>, making better use of
          the core’s available resources. It is not parallelism in the true
          sense (as seen with multiple cores), but it helps reduce wasted cycles
          when a single thread isn't fully utilizing the core, leading to better
          overall performance in multi-threaded workloads.
